# Waste Classifier ♻️

## Project Description
[Waste Classifier](https://waste-classifier-dvnkd7jhsqmjiyvbmkaqpx.streamlit.app/) is an AI-powered application built with Python and Streamlit that classifies images of waste into different types (Plastic, Organic, Paper, Metal, E-waste). The app also provides recycling tips and highlights the health, environmental, and climatic hazards associated with each type of waste. This project promotes sustainable development and responsible waste management practices.
